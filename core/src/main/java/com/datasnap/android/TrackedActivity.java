/**
 * This activity automatically initializes the datasnap.io Android client.
 *
 * The client is an HTTP wrapper over the Segment.io REST API. It will allow
 * you to conveniently consume the API without making any HTTP requests
 * yourself.
 *
 * This client is also designed to be thread-safe and to not block each of
 * your calls to make a HTTP request. It uses batching to efficiently send
 * your requests on a separate resource-constrained thread pool.
